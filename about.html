    <pre class="about-text"><p class="about-first">Nemesis is a Dhaka based Bangladeshi rock band formed in 1999. With their debut album "Onneshon", the band came into prominence as one of the leading young bands of the underground era. Over the next few years, Nemesis built on that reputation and released their second album "Tritio Jatra" in 2011 and the video of their single "Kobe" which propelled them into the national consciousness.  After going through a metamorphosis for a few years, the band emerged with a new line up and released their third album "Gonojowar" in 2017.
